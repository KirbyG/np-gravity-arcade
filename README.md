# Reducing 3SAT to Gravity-based Arcade Games
We have developed a novel proof technique for demonstrating NP-completeness of simple arcade games that rely on gravity as a primary mechanic. This project supports an upcoming paper (<paper-filename>.pdf) that applies the technique to Popils and Megalit.

## How to Use
Lorem ipsum

## DIMACS CNF Format
By convention, Boolean Satisfiability problems in CNF form have a `.cnf` extension, while the rest have a `.sat` extension.

## (Non-exhaustive) TODO List
### jacob
* remove manual cmd line entry
* adopt DIMACS CNF input format
* add input example to this file
* convert existing files to new format and .cnf extension
* Make README more useful

### kirby
* blocks can see their slabs
* scrolling
* class breakouts
* megalit
	* comment scrolling code
	* reduction (fix obvious issue first in g-sheets)
	* solver
### both
* fix Game repr
* allow exit during solve
* refactor code (comments and organization)
* write the actual paper
